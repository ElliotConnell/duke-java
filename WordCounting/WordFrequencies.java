/**
 * Write a description of WordFrequencies here.
 * You will write a program to determine the word that occurs the most often in a file. 
 * If more than one word occurs as the most often, then return the first such word found. 
 * You should make all words lowercase before counting them. Thus, “This” and “this” will
 * both be counted as the lowercase version of “this”. You should not consider punctuation,
 * so “end” and “end,” will be considered different words. Use the WordFrequencies program
 * in the lesson as a starting point.
