/**
 * Write a description of WordLengths here.
 * You will write a program to figure out the most common word length of words from a file. 
 * To solve this problem you will need to keep track of how many words from a file are of each possible length.
 * You should group all words of length 30 or more together, 
 * and you should not count basic punctuation that are the first or last characters of a group of characters.
